prompt.chat.system.prefix=Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:
prompt.chat.system.suffix=Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
prompt.chat.format.instructions=The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\
  Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).\
  \
  The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}\
  \
  The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\
  ```\
  {{{{\
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,\
  "action_input": $INPUT\
  }}}}\
  ```\
  ALWAYS use the following format:\
  Question: the input question you must answer\
  Thought: you should always think about what to do\
  Action:\
  ```\
  $JSON_BLOB\
  ```\
  Observation: the result of the action\
  ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)\
  Thought: I now know the final answer\
  Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

prompt.mrkl.prefix=Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

  API Documentation\
  The API endpoint /v1/forecast accepts a geographical coordinate, a list of weather variables and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today and contains 168 hours. All URL parameters are listed below:\
  \
  Parameter	Format	Required	Default	Description\
  latitude, longitude	Floating point	Yes		Geographical WGS84 coordinate of the location\
  hourly	String array	No		A list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &hourly= parameter in the URL can be used.\
  daily	String array	No		A list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required.\
  current_weather	Bool	No	false	Include current weather conditions in the JSON output.\
  temperature_unit	String	No	celsius	If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit.\
  windspeed_unit	String	No	kmh	Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn\
  precipitation_unit	String	No	mm	Other precipitation amount units: inch\
  timeformat	String	No	iso8601	If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date.\
  timezone	String	No	GMT	If timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the time zone database is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone.\
  past_days	Integer (0-2)	No	0	If past_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned.\
  start_date\
  end_date	String (yyyy-mm-dd)	No		The time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30).\
  models	String array	No	auto	Manually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather models will be combined.\
  \
  Hourly Parameter Definition\
  The parameter &hourly= accepts the following values. Most weather variables are given as an instantaneous value for the indicated hour. Some variables like precipitation are calculated from the preceding hour as an average or sum.\
  \
  Variable	Valid time	Unit	Description\
  temperature_2m	Instant	°C (°F)	Air temperature at 2 meters above ground\
  snowfall	Preceding hour sum	cm (inch)	Snowfall amount of the preceding hour in centimeters. For the water equivalent in millimeter, divide by 7. E.g. 7 cm snow = 10 mm precipitation water equivalent\
  rain	Preceding hour sum	mm (inch)	Rain from large scale weather systems of the preceding hour in millimeter\
  showers	Preceding hour sum	mm (inch)	Showers from convective precipitation in millimeters from the preceding hour\
  weathercode	Instant	WMO code	Weather condition as a numeric code. Follow WMO weather interpretation codes. See table below for details.\
  snow_depth	Instant	meters	Snow depth on the ground\
  freezinglevel_height	Instant	meters	Altitude above sea level of the 0°C level\
  visibility	Instant	meters	Viewing distance in meters. Influenced by low clouds, humidity and aerosols. Maximum visibility is approximately 24 km.
