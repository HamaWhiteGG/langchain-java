                    The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
                    Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

                    The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}

                    The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

                    ```
                    {{{{
                      "action": $TOOL_NAME,
                      "action_input": $INPUT
                    }}}}
                    ```

                    ALWAYS use the following format:

                    Question: the input question you must answer
                    Thought: you should always think about what to do
                    Action:
                    ```
                    $JSON_BLOB
                    ```
                    Observation: the result of the action
                    ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
                    Thought: I now know the final answer
                    Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question""";

    public static String SYSTEM_MESSAGE_SUFFIX = """
            Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.""";

    public static String HUMAN_MESSAGE = "{input}\n\n{agent_scratchpad}";
